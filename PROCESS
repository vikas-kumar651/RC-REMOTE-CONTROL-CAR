Components Required:   Arduino Uno : L298N motor driver : IR receiver : Jumper Wire : 9 volt battery & 2 BO MOTOR : base of car with 3 wheels

                               ****  FOLLOW these instructions for making ir remote car ********
                               
:: First of all connect 2 BO-MOTOR with car base..
:: Now connect motor with L298N motor Driver...
   * L298N motor driver has 4 OUTPUT pins, so you can control 2 BO Motor.
   * So now connect out1 & out2 with Motor 1 and out3 & out4 with Motor 2.
  
:: Now connect Arduino and L298N motor driver with Jumper wires...
   * L298N motor driver has 4 INPUT pins, connect these pins by Arduino digital pins.
   * in1 & in2 for motor 1 and in3 & in4 for motor 2.
::  Now connect IR receiver with arduino
   * ir receiver has 3 pins ( ground, signal, power {+5 volt})
   
:: Now first of all note Value of IR remote keys with help of arduino(code is given).

:: then Put that values in Main code in switch case..



IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
1: if you want to control speed of car than connect L298N motor driver PIN ENA & ENB with arduino PWM pin,than you can control speed by varying
   PWM pin value. 
2: The L298N module can drive DC motors that have voltages between 5 and 35V, but if voltage is <12 than you can use +5volt for 5 volt output 
   and by use of this you can charge Arduino.
